    "description": "This board is a blend of the high performance surfboard design you'd want to take to the water to rip and the benefits you get from a twin fin. Christenson didn't want to have another typical swallow tail shape when thinking of the lane splitter so he kept this one as a squash tail."

    "description": "Built with performance in mind, the longer, straighter rail line provides you with extreme speed. This thing is built for big open face turns. However, is one of those designs that provides joy in a wide range of conditions."
